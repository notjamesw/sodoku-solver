# sodoku-solver

A highschool computer science project programmed in Java. It automatically solves a sodoku puzzle (in the form of a txt file) using 4 levels of logic. The zip files contains 3 test sodoku puzzles labelled "easy," "medium," and "hard" indicating level of difficulty. The program will prompt for a level of difficulty and then solve the puzzle by looping the logic functions and displaying each step in the console. It was programmed in repl.it and downloaded as a zip file.
